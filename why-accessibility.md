## Why Accessibility?

In the UK alone some 11 million people suffer from a disability. Nearly 2 million of these are blind, and 40,000 are 25 years old or younger. www.disabilitysport.org.uk

Of course, not all disabilities make it difficult for people to use the web, but what is important is that anyone creating digital tools and online content should understand how their audience accesses their interfaces and information.

>â€œWeb accessibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to websites on the World Wide Web, by people with disabilities. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, generally all users have equal access to information and functionality. [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility)
