<h3 id="what-are-websockets">What are WebSockets?</h3>

<p>WebSocket is a protocol that enables bidirectional communication between the client and the server of a web application over a single long living TCP connection.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overheads, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the client without being first requested by the client, and allowing messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open. In this way, a two-way ongoing conversation can take place between the client and the server.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The communications are done over TCP port number 80 (or 443 in the case of TLS-encrypted connections), which is of benefit for those environments which block non-web Internet connections using a firewall. Similar two-way browser-server communications have been achieved in non-standardized ways using stopgap technologies such as Comet.</p>
